# Bcrypt for Node.js

This is a porting of bcrypt module using N-API.

Please don't use this respository to install the module. I created it only to 
execute some performance tests and for my article about the proces I followed 
on doing this porting.

Refer to the official repo of **[bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js)** 

If you want contribute to the official porting of bcrypt you can do it making
